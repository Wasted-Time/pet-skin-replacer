# pet-skin-replacer
Customize your pet's appearance

## Info
- Creatures not used as pets normally have collision, to avoid bumping into them in combat use `pet stay` option (then even using Leaping Strike right into pet's face won't hinder your movement)   
- Feel free to use info in `DC` folder to find more `huntingZoneId` and `templateId` to set from any existing creatures out there  
- Module is client-side only, that means only you can see the difference. Nobody else can see your new pet.	

## Usage
### `pet`
- Toggle on/off
### `pet ?`
- Outputs a list of available pet presets
### `pet set [preset_name]`
- Set your pet from a preset. (Example: `pet set felicity` will make your pet into a white cat with a flower on its head!)
### `pet setid [huntingZoneId] [templateId]`
- Set your pet from any NPC model. You need to know the templateId and huntingZoneId though. (eg `pet set id 983 950` to summon goddess Velik herself from the very heavens)
### `pet save`
- Saves current pet configuration into a per-character savefile which would get loaded next time you login onto this character
### `pet reload`
- Reloads current pet configuration from a per-character savefile (or resets to default if it doesn't exist)
### `pet size [size]`
- Sets pet size (eg `pet size 1.5` to make it 50% bigger or `0.1` to make it 10x times smaller)
### `pet name [name]`
- Sets pet name to one specified
### `pet move [number]`
- Set movement type for your pet (some NPCs and monsters might have multiple types of animations you can choose from):
```
-1 = copy players movetype (eg jump when you jump etc) (works only with "pet stay" option enabled),
0 = running, 1 = walking, 2 = falling, 5 = jumping,
6 = jump intersection and end when something is blocking the path and the player can't travel in the X and Y axis
7 = stop moving, landing, 8 = swimming, 9 = stop swimming, 10 = falling after jumping
```
### `pet stay [degrees] [distance]`
- Set pet to stay near you at [distance] units away at [degrees] degrees (eg `90` degrees - is at right, `-90` is at left, `180` is in the back)
### `pet play [animation]`
- Plays a custom animation on the pet (eg `pet play death`), animations are listed in the DataCenter files
### `pet anim [animation] [newAnimation] [loopDuration]`
- Set a pet to play custom animation instead of existing ones (eg `pet anim run walk 988` to set a new running animation to be the same as walking one with the repeat loop timing of 998 milliseconds), [loopDuration] argument is only needed for `run` and `walk` animations list of replacable animations:  
```
jump
spawn
death		(when pet disappears)
skill		(when pet uses his power buff skill on you)
unarmedwait	(pose for when custom run or walk animations should end too soon)
walk		(partners are unable to walk unless you set them this custom animation)
run			(non-partner pets can only use walk animation unless you set them this custom animation)
```
